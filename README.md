# Patient Visit Analysis for Emergency Care

## Description
This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive visualization of patient visit trends in the Emergency Room. It enables healthcare providers to gain actionable insights into patient demographics, visit patterns, and service ratings.

## Key Features
#### 1. Patient Visit Overview: 
Total patient visits categorized by administrative and non-administrative appointments.

#### 2. Satisfaction Analysis:
Average satisfaction ratings and percentage of unrated services.

### 3. Demographic Insights: 
Patient visits broken down by age group, gender, and race.

### 4. Trend Analysis: 
Year-over-year patient visit trends and weekday vs. weekend visit patterns.

### 5. Departmental Breakdown: 
Number of patients referred to specific medical departments.

### 6. Wait Time Visualization: 
Heatmap analysis of average patient wait times by age and race.

## Detailed Analysis
### 1. Patient Visits Overview
The dashboard highlights a total of 4,632 patient visits, split almost evenly between Administrative Appointments (49.35%) and Non-Administrative Appointments (50.65%).
The visit trends show a higher preference for services on weekdays (3.3K visits) compared to weekends (1.3K visits).
### 2. Satisfaction and Service Metrics
The average satisfaction rating is 5.45, indicating a need to explore ways to improve the patient experience.
A significant portion of services (75.71%) remains unrated, suggesting either insufficient feedback collection mechanisms or gaps in patient engagement during visits.
### 3. Demographic Insights
Age Distribution: The majority of visits are from adults (78%), followed by teenagers and middle childhood groups. This indicates the need for services tailored to adult health concerns.
Gender Distribution: Patient visits are split almost evenly by gender, with 51.5% male and 48.2% female patients.
Race Distribution: A heatmap reveals disparities in average wait times across races, which could indicate potential inequities in service delivery.
### 4. Departmental Referrals
No Department Referrals account for 2.7K visits, which might represent patients seeking general consultations or those who left without being assigned to specific departments.
Among referrals, General Practice (0.9K visits) and Orthopedics (0.5K visits) are the top departments, reflecting the primary needs of patients.
### 5. Wait Time Analysis
The average wait time across all patients is 35.53 minutes, with some variability by demographic groups.
The heatmap of wait times shows that certain groups (e.g., specific age or race categories) experience longer delays, which might signal areas for operational improvement.
### 6. Yearly Trends
Patient visits have grown from 2,177 in 2019 to 2,455 in 2020, a 12.8% increase. This upward trend suggests increased demand for emergency services, potentially indicating population growth or a rising need for healthcare access.
### 7. Key Findings
Operational Gaps: High percentages of unrated services and long wait times for specific groups highlight opportunities for better service delivery.
Growth Opportunities: Analyzing growth in specific demographics or departments can guide resource allocation.
Engagement Challenges: The high number of "No Department Referrals" visits suggests opportunities to guide patients more effectively.
